# TOEIC Marketing Compliance Guide
**Reference Document for Brizzle TOEIC Course Content Management System**

This document summarizes the key compliance rules from the TOEIC Marketing Guide (January 2025) to ensure all website content adheres to ETS guidelines.

## Critical Rules

### 1. Prohibited Terms: "Partner" / "Partnership"
**Rule:** It is NOT possible to use the word "Partner" (or "Partenaire" in French) when referring to ETS, ETS EMEA, or the TOEIC tests.

**Approved Alternatives:**
- Collaboration
- Joint effort
- Strategic relationship
- Market ambassador
- ETS Preferred Associate (official designation)

### 2. TOEIC Trademark Usage
- **Always use the ® symbol** after "TOEIC" - at least at the first occurrence in any text
- **Never use "TOEIC" alone** - must always be followed by a generic term like "tests", "certification", "scores"
- **Correct examples:**
  - TOEIC® tests
  - The TOEIC® 4-Skills tests
  - The TOEIC® Listening and Reading tests
  - The TOEIC® Speaking and Writing tests
  - TOEIC® certification
  - TOEIC® scores

### 3. Proper Test Names
Use these exact names:
- **TOEIC® 4-Skills tests** (NOT "Listening & Speaking / 4 Skills")
- **TOEIC® Listening and Reading tests**
- **TOEIC® Speaking and Writing tests**
- **TOEIC Bridge® tests**

### 4. EPA Designation
- Use "ETS Preferred Associate" as the official designation
- The EPA logo graphic can be used alongside your organization's logo
- EPA logo must be same size or smaller than your organization's logo
- EPA logo cannot be modified (colors, fonts, text, size)

### 5. Website Text Guidelines
- Website should be clearly identified with your company's brand
- Should NOT look like an ETS or TOEIC-branded website
- Clearly separate TOEIC products/services from your own products/services
- Use language that correctly describes ownership: "Use our preparation course to practice for the TOEIC® tests" (NOT "Practice with [your company] TOEIC questions")

### 6. Logo Placement (for websites)
- TOEIC logo must appear in top-left position
- Minimum clear space around logo (buffer zone)
- Logo must appear in brand's primary color (dark green)
- Appropriate contrast must be ensured
